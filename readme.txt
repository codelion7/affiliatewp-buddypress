Integrate AffiliateWP with BuddyPress.

== Description ==

Once activated, this plugin creates a BuddyPress Profile Tab for each tab of the Affiliate Area:

* URLs
* Stats
* Graphs
* Referrals
* Visits
* Creatives
* Settings
* Sub Affiliates
* Coupons (Coming Soon)
* Order Details (Coming Soon)

If a user is not an affiliate, it will display the Affiliate Registration page on their profile instead.


This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") and [BuddyPress](http://buddypress.org/ "BuddyPress") in order to function.


Remember to set your Affiliate Area page in Affiliates &rarr; Settings to be your [login page](http://docs.affiliatewp.com/article/98-affiliatelogin "Affiliate Login Shortcode") or your affiliates will have no where to login from via emails etc.
